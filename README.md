Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
Initiating the business relationship is often overly complicated and cumbersome in a way that is unnecessary in the preliminary stages.

Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
The app abstracts away the complications of initiating the contact phase by allowing both jobseekers and employers to create profiles and express interest quickly and simply.

What is the mission statement?
Our app helps to match employers and job seekers who are mutually interested in extending the conversation to explore the potential future of a business relationship.

- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
  Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
